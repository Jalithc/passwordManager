# CLI Password Manager

## Overview
This Python script implements a simple command-line password manager. It allows users to securely register, login, and manage passwords for different websites. The passwords are encrypted using the Fernet symmetric encryption library, providing an additional layer of security.

## Features
- **User Registration and Login:** Users can register with a username and a master password. The master password is securely hashed and stored.
- **Password Management:** Users can add and retrieve passwords for various websites. Passwords are encrypted before storage to enhance security.
- **Key Generation and Encryption:** The script generates an encryption key for securing password data and uses Fernet for encryption and decryption.
- **Clipboard Integration:** Decrypted passwords can be copied to the clipboard for convenient use.

## How to Use
1. **Register:** Run the script, choose the registration option, and enter a username and master password.
2. **Login:** Use the registered username and master password to log in.
